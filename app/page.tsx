          <p>In early 2023, I decided to chase a new passion of mine: software engineering. Wanting to push myself to better my skills, I enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp in April of 2023. During this experience, I built full-stack applications and deepended my knowledge of JavaScript and Python. Additionally, I learned some new skills, such as React.
          <br />
          <br />
          I come from the audio tech industry where I worked as a Customer Support Specialist for three years. Succeeding in this role allowed me to walk away with a deep love for creatively problem solving, as well as connecting with customers to understand their needs and solving their problems.This is largely what lead me to the software engineering industry: to be able to creatively solve problems using code.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am currently looking for my first software development role. Although I do not have the most experience, I do have an unwavering tenacity to consistently learn and develop my skills. One thing my bootcamp experience taught me is how to learn complex topics in a short period of time. I can't wait for the opportunity to bring my knowledge and desire for learning to a company.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I am not working, you can catch me working out in the gym, hiking a mountain, or making music in the studio. I am passionate about personal health and I love to express myself creatively.
